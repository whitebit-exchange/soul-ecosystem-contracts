 * @title Soul attribute interface
 * One of soul feature implementations.
 * Soul attributes represent changeable soul features (e.g. hold amount, trade volume etc).
 * @dev Each attribute should be a single contract with its own values specification.
 * Values are stored in registry and are mapped by attribute contract address.
 * The chosen value type is bytes20 because:
 * - the value's slot may be extended with any 12 bytes of data (registry will store set at/updated at there);
 * - this size is quite enough for most cases, and it can be easily extended with dictionaries.
 * If you want to store some complex attributes that don't fit into bytes20, you can create values dictionary
 * (a key is a bytes20 accessor (e.g. ripemd160 hash), a value is anything you want to represent).
 * There is no interface for dictionaries because the value type is unpredictable,
 * so dictionary implementation is up to devs.
